## What does it do?
Spaced-Repetiton Learning is a revolutionary technique proven to increase one ability to retain complex data
it works using a special algorithm that is described as 
> - Given a list of questions with corresponding "memory values", M, starting at 1:
> - Take the first question in the list
> - Ask the question
>- If the answer was correct:
>- Double the value of M
>- Else, if the answer was wrong:
> - Reset M to 1
>- Move the question back M places in the list
